### PROJECT TOPIC: PAYROLL DATA ANALYSIS

#### Project Overview
I analyzed payroll data to identify trends, optimize costs, and improve employee satisfaction.

#### Objective
The objective of this project is to analyze payroll data and provide insights that can help optimize costs and improve employee satisfaction.

#### Dataset
The dataset used for this project includes payroll data with the following fields:

- Employee ID
- Name
- Department
- Job Title
- Salary
- Benefits
- Taxes

#### Tools Used
- Excel: Data cleaning and preprocessing
- SQL: Data querying and manipulation
- Power BI: Data visualization and reporting


#### Key Findings
- Identified trends in payroll costs and benefits
- Developed a dashboard to track payroll metrics in real-time
- Provided insights on how to optimize payroll costs and improve employee satisfaction

### Excel
#### Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
- Removed duplicates using the "Remove Duplicates" feature
- Handled missing values using the "IFERROR" function
- Transformed date fields using the "TEXT" function

Formula:

`=IFERROR(VLOOKUP(A2,EmployeeData,2,FALSE),"Not Found")`

#### This formula looks up the employee ID in the "EmployeeData" table and returns the corresponding employee name. If the ID is not found, it returns "Not Found".
